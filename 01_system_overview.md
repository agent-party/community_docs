# Agent Party System Overview

## Vision and Mission

Agent Party is an AI agent orchestration platform designed to enable automated team formation and collaboration between AI agents. The system analyzes user tasks, dynamically configures agents, and assembles them into collaborative teams visualized through a real-time interface.

### Mission Statement

To create a scalable, observable, and reliable platform for AI agent collaboration that optimizes team composition, maximizes task success rates, and provides transparent insights into agent operations.

## Core Concepts

### Agent

An AI entity with specific capabilities, personality traits, and parameters that can perform specialized functions within a team. Agents are instantiated from templates and progress through a defined lifecycle.

#### Agent Types

- **Talent Scout**: Responsible for agent template creation and configuration
- **Bartender**: Responsible for team assembly and management
- **DJ**: GNN-based recommendation engine for team composition
- **Task-specific Agents**: Agents with capabilities tailored to specific task requirements

### Template

A blueprint for creating agent instances, defining their capabilities, personality traits, and base parameters. Templates can be created automatically by the Talent Scout or manually by humans.

### Team

A collection of agents assembled to complete a specific task, with roles and relationships defined to maximize collaboration effectiveness.

### Task

A user-submitted job to be completed by a team of agents, with defined requirements, parameters, and expected outputs.

### Capability

A specific skill or function that an agent can perform, used for matching agents to task requirements.
